## [Web Sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket)

1. What is a Web Socket?
  - Computer Communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
2. Describe the Web Socket request/response handshake and what happens once the connection is established.
  - it creates a live two-way connection
3. Web Sockets provide a standardized way for the server to send content to a client without first receiving a **REQUEST** from that client.

## [Socket.io Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/socket.io/)

1. What does the event handler io.on() do?
  - real-time bidirectional event-based communication. 
2. Describe some possible proof of life or proof that the code works as expected
  - socket.io to check proof of life
3. What does socket.emit() do?
  - its a request

## [Socket.io vs Web Sockets](https://www.educba.com/websocket-vs-socket-io/)

1. What is the difference between WebSocket and Socket.IO? (think Git and GitHub, or OAuth and Auth0).
  - WebSocket remains open all the time, so they allow real-time data transfer. 
  - It provides the Connection over TCP, while Socket.io is a library to abstract the WebSocket connections.
2. When would you use Socket.IO?
  - for more secure routes
3. When would you use WebSockets?
  - for more live communications
