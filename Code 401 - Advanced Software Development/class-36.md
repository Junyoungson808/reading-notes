  -Everything that changes in your application, including the data and the UI state, is contained in a single object, we call the state or the state tree.
2. what is a store and what do we use our reducers for within that store?
  -Store holds current state, we keep state in a variable and use a function to return the current value of that variable.

  -getState: gets current applications state.
  -subscribe: subscribe to changes and rerender our application
  -dispatch: change our application state by dispatching an action.
4. Explain to a non-technical recruiter what combineReducers() does and why it is useful.
