## Stacks and Queues

what is a stack?: A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

What kind of operations can we perform on a stack?

Queue: First In First Out (FIFO): The first object into a queue is the first object to leave the queue, used by a queue.
Stack: Last In First Out (LIFO): The last object into a stack is the first object to leave the stack, used by a stack

OR

Stack: First In Last Out (FILO): The first object or item in a stack is the last object or item to leave the stack.
Queue: Last In Last Out (LILO): The last object or item in a queue is the last object or item to leave the queue.

Stacks stack on top of each other and can either be added or removed or both to the stack with above methods.
