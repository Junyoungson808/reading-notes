## [Review API Server Build](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/apps-and-libraries/api-server/)

1. Explain the different between a query string parameter and a path parameter.
  Query String Parameter allows you to filter for specifics, while a path parameter identifies a specific resource or resources.
2. What would our API URL with a path id parameter be given the following information:
      1. Domain: <http://our-site.com>          our website.
      2. v3                                     version of our api
      3. model name: stuff                      where the 'model' is the name of the data model to operate on
      4. id: things                             specific 'id' number of a specific entity

3. We have created a dynamic API with an “interface”. Describe how that interface works to a non-technical friend.
  - Interface is what the user sees, how they can interact with our application and hopefully easy to use.

### [Review Auth Server Build](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/apps-and-libraries/auth-server/)

1. Describe how you would use middleware to implement basic and bearer auth.
  - Middleware would authenticate users and allow them certain rights in the application in signing up etc.
2. Describe the handshake necessary to implement OAuth.
  - When a user signs into their account, it will recieve a 'handshake' when it authenticates a signin. 
3. Describe how Role Based Access Control works to a non-technical friend.
  - In a business we all have roles, similarly to an application not everyone should have all the rights to the application if so they'd either destroy the application. So we control what users do with Role based access control.
