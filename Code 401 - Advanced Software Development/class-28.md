    - it lets you perform side effects in function components.
2. When using the useEffect Hook:
    - What does useEffect do?
        - By using this Hook, you tell React that your component needs to do something after render.
    - Why is useEffect called inside a component?
        - lets us access the count state variable (or any props) right from the effect.

Reflection

- What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?
  - I would like to access the class readme, but the link is broken, but in reality I would hope to be able to whiteboard and build some cool apps outside of lab and codefellows. I'm glad that codefellows does teach a lot of material so I can review it again once I graduate and build up more tools for my career as a software dev.
