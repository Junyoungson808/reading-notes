# Implementation: Linked Lists

To turn in your reading “Reply” to this discussion by teaching something that you learned. Then review what one of your classmates learned, and leave a comment.

Some ideas for how you might want to teach:

what is a linked list?
a data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.



Suppose a teacher along with her 100 students goes to watch a movie. On reaching the theatre, the teacher is sad to know that 100 continuous seats are not available for her students. The students will sit in the theatre in a scattered way. To assemble her students after the movie, she needs to know where every single one of them is sitting.

"How will I remember 100 seat numbers?", she thinks. Then an idea strikes her. She tells her students to form a line and assigns each one of them with an unoccupied seat number. She also tells the students to remember the seat number of the student standing behind him/her. Now the teacher need to know seat number of only the first child. By asking the seat number of the next student from the first student she can go to the second student. In this way she can know where all the other students are sitting by knowing only 1 address.

Exchange seat number with memory locations and you have a singly linked list where each node(student) points to the address of next node. If each student would have remembered the seat numbers of the preceding as well as next student, we would have a doubly linked list.
