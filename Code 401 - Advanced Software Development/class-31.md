## [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)

1. What can React Context provide your app?
  - It can help by providing a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
2. Why might we use Context?
  - Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible by many components at the different nesting levels.  
3. Why should we use it sparingly?
  - it makes components reuse more difficult. 

## [Awesome React Context links](https://github.com/diegohaz/awesome-react-context)

1. Consume content from (at least) two of the Awesome React Context links. Share your take-away from each:
    - Takeaway 1: Theme toggle with the use of context api is a cool tool and could be used in many different ways, either in styling or showing more dynamic interaction for users in a app, and much more.
    - Takeaway 2: [with-context](https://github.com/SunHuawei/with-context) pretty cool resourse showing how to style many leaf's or endpoints by linking the theme to the branch.
       import { withContext } from "with-context";

      export const ThemeContext = React.createContext("light");
      export const withTheme = withContext(ThemeContext, "theme");

      import { withTheme } from "./withTheme";
      import { styles } from "../consts";

    @withTheme
      export default class LeafComponent extends React.PureComponent {
        render() {
          const { theme } = this.props;
        return (
            <div style={styles[theme]}>LeafComponent with theme: {theme}</div>
          );
        }
      }
