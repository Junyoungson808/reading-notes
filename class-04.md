### 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.
    1. learning from fellow students
    2. job interview readiness 
    - These two I feel will greatly help me on my CodeFellows journey. I've already seen it in action and already help me in my coding. After showing my code to my fellow classmates I was able to figure out some of my mistakes and make corrections. I am a little shy and it helps me understand and how to talk with others in a coding environment.
