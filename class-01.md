# Class 1 

  ## Getting Started 
    - I want to see a web page
      Web page is what I want to see
      HTTP requests the server till I can see
      I wait for the server to say "200 Ok" 
      Then I can see the web page!
      Thank you HTTP!
    - HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser by:
      1. browswer parses the HTML file first- leads to recognize <link> + <script>
        - <link>-element references to external CSS stylesheets
        - <script>-element references to scripts
    - Images : You can google images. 
      -Google and image
      -Click Image you like // use Google license filter to filter copyrighted images - choose creative commons license
      -Right click image (Ctrl + Click (Mac)) - save image as... 
    - String VS Numbers:
      -String - have 'text' around them  //  let myVariable = 'Bob'
      -Numbers - numbers = 1,2,3,4,etc...  //  let myVariable = 10
    - Variables : are containers that store values. Without Variables we wouldn't be able to do anything dynamic in coding or programming. We couldn't customize or change anything on how they look or function. 

  ## Introduction to HTML
    - HTML : Hyper Text Markup Language // HTML Attributes are extra information about the element that wont appear in the content. E
        * Example: <p **class="editor-note"**>My God is very angry</p>
    - HTML anatomy :
        1. Space between it and the element name.
        2. The attribute name, followed by = sign
        3. An attribute value, wraped with opening and closing quote marks
    - |             <Article>              |     VS      |              <Section>              |
        Article: Encloses a block of related content that makes sense on its own without the rest of the page. 
        Section: Grouping together a single part of the page that constitutes one single piece of functionality.
    - Elements of HTML
        1. Header
        2. Navigation bar
        3. Main Content
        4. Sidebar
        5. Footer
    - <meta> : Meta tag specifies the document's character encoding - the character set that the document is permitted to use.

  ## Semantics
    - H1 is a semantic tag that gives what ever it wraps around the role or meaning of a "a top level heading on your page".
      Span tag you can make anything look like a heading, but does not have the any semantic value. 
    - Benefits of using Semantic Tags in HTML:
        1. Search engines will consider its contents as important key words to influence search rankings
        2. Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate the page
        3. Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or without semantic or namespaced classes
        4. Suggests to the dev the type of data that will be populated
        5. Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming
