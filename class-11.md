### Video and Audio Content

1. Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.
    - It evolved from using flash then to silverlight to now modern html5 with the use of audio and video tags that would allow users to inbed audio and video files. With the increase in bandwith allows us to use audio and videos in our webpages. 
2. Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the <video> element.
    -   <video src="rabbit320.webm" controls>
        <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a <a href="rabbit320.webm">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
        </video>
            In the same way as for the <img> element, the src (source) attribute contains a path to the video you want to embed. It works in exactly the same way.
3. Why is it important to have fallback content inside the <video> element?
    -   Helps visitors see or understand content of  the webpage in case of the video or audio not properly functioning.
4. Write a very short story where <audio> and <video> are characters.
    -   Audio and Video where two such wonderful things that they wanted everyone to know who they were.

             elva-fairy-800w.jpg 800w"
        sizes="(max-width: 600px) 480px,
            800px"
        src="elva-fairy-800w.jpg"
        alt="Elva dressed as a fairy">
        - srcset defines the set of images we will allow the browser to choose between, and what size each image is.
        - sizes defines a set of media conditions (e.g. screen widths) and indicates what image size would be best to choose, when certain media conditions are true
